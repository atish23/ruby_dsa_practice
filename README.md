# DSA Practice Repository

![1_sMryEXZVPKFjGNcfSzE8Mw](https://github.com/atish23/ruby_dsa_practice/assets/16266389/8b84191d-d918-4867-949b-96a1029980d6)


This repository contains a collection of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) practice solutions implemented in Ruby. Each file focuses on a specific algorithm or data structure, providing a reference implementation along with example usage or test cases.

## Files

- `array_sum_two.rb`: Implements a function to find pairs in an array that sum up to a given target.
- `binary_search.rb`: Provides an iterative and recursive implementation of the binary search algorithm.
- `factorial.rb`: Computes the factorial of a given number using recursion.
- `linear_search.rb`: Implements the linear search algorithm to find an element in an array.
- `maxSubArraySum.rb`: Finds the maximum sum of a subarray within a given array using Kadane's algorithm.
- `prime.rb`: Checks whether a given number is prime or not.
- `recursive.rb`: Contains recursive implementations of various algorithms, such as Fibonacci and factorial.
- `rotate_array.rb`: Rotates an array to the right by a given number of steps.
- `sieve.rb`: Implements the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to find prime numbers up to a given limit.
- `sum_array.rb`: Computes the sum of all elements in an array using recursion.
- `towerOfBramha.rb`: Solves the Tower of Hanoi puzzle recursively.
- `web-rack`: Placeholder directory for a web application built with Ruby's Rack framework.

## Usage

Feel free to explore the code and use it as a reference for your own DSA practice. Each file is self-contained and can be executed independently to see the algorithm in action or run test cases. You can modify the code or build upon it to suit your specific needs.

## Contributing

If you have any improvements, suggestions, or additional DSA solutions to share, contributions are welcome! Fork this repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request. Please follow the existing code style and provide clear commit messages.
